# XP Core Values in Action: Team SYNERGY's Approach to BookTable Development
---
Team SYNERGY consistently applied Extreme Programming (XP) core values throughout the development lifecycle of the BookTable application. Our commitment to **Communication**, **Courage**, and **Respect** fostered a collaborative, adaptive, and resilient team environment. 

## üì¢ Communication: Fostering Clarity and Collaboration

* **Regular Team Sync-Ups & Pair Programming:** We held daily stand-ups and frequent ad-hoc discussions to address blockers, share progress, and make collective decisions. Pair programming sessions were utilized for complex tasks, facilitating knowledge sharing and immediate feedback.
* **Shared Documentation and Knowledge Base:** We maintained a central repository for project information, designs (Figma), and documentation (Confluence), ensuring all team members had access to up-to-date information.
* **Transparent Stakeholder Updates:** We proactively communicated project status, potential challenges, and achievements to our project instructor, ensuring expectations were managed effectively.
* **Adapting Communication to Challenges:** When our team structure changed unexpectedly, we intensified our communication. This included an immediate replanning session to openly discuss impacts and reallocate responsibilities, ensuring a smooth transition and continued project momentum.

## üí™ Courage: Tackling Challenges and Embracing Change

* **Taking Ownership and Addressing Complexities:** Team members demonstrated courage by taking full ownership of their features, from backend infrastructure to intricate UI flows and robust authentication mechanisms.
* **Adapting to Change:** The unexpected reduction in team size required significant courage. Remaining members willingly embraced expanded roles and new responsibilities, often stepping outside their primary expertise to ensure project continuity.
* **Making Difficult Prioritization Decisions:** We courageously re-evaluated sprint goals and project scope when faced with constraints, making pragmatic choices to ensure the delivery of a high-quality core product.
* **Learning and Applying New Technologies:** The team showed courage in learning and implementing various technologies across the stack, including AWS services (Cognito, S3, SES, Elastic Beanstalk), Docker, and modern frontend frameworks.

## üôè Respect: Valuing Contributions and Fostering Collaboration

* **Valuing Diverse Skills and Perspectives:** We fostered an environment where every team member's ideas and skills were valued. During feature development (e.g., Restaurant Management, Admin Portal, Booking System), we encouraged collaborative problem-solving and respected different approaches.
* **Supporting Each Other Through Challenges:** When faced with increased workloads or complex technical hurdles, team members proactively offered assistance and shared knowledge, demonstrating respect for each other's well-being and capacity.
* **Professionalism with Stakeholders:** We maintained a respectful and professional demeanor in all communications with our project instructor and any external parties.
* **Respect for Shared Code Ownership:** Through practices like code reviews and adhering to consistent coding standards (facilitated by tools like linters and automated checks), we respected the collective codebase.
* **Empathy in Challenging Times**: The team handled the unexpected change in team size with empathy, respecting the departing member's situation and focusing on constructive solutions rather than blame.
